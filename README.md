# Gravity-Marble

This project was made with Unity 3D and programmed in C#.

# Gameplay

The goal of this game is to role a marble from where you start to the finish platform at the end of a randomly generated track. As you role over slants and curves, gravity will change so that you always roll flat across the platforms you are over.

'WASD' to roll.
'R' to respawn.
'G' to generate a new track.

This project got as far as I had intended for it to get. There are known issues with track generation and if you run into any issues with a track that can not be completed, generate a new one by pressing 'G'.
